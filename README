NAME
    Perinci::AccessUtil - Utility module for Riap client/server

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.03 of Perinci::AccessUtil (from Perl
    distribution Perinci-AccessUtil), released on 2014-10-23.

SYNOPSIS
     use Perinci::AccessUtil qw(strip_riap_stuffs_from_res);
     my $res = strip_riap_stuffs_from_res([200,"OK"]);

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  insert_riap_stuffs_to_res($envres[, $def_ver, $nmeta]) => array
    Starting in Riap protocol v1.2, server is required to return "riap.v" in
    result metadata. This routine does just that. In addition to that, this
    routine also encodes result with base64 when necessary.

    This routine is used by Riap network server libraries, e.g.
    Perinci::Access::HTTP::Server and Perinci::Access::Simple::Server.

  strip_riap_stuffs_from_res($envres) => array
    Starting in Riap protocol v1.2, client is required to check and strip
    all "riap.*" keys in result metadata ("$envres->[3]"). This routine does
    just that. In addition, this routine also decode result if
    "riap.result_encoding" is set, so the user already gets the decoded
    content.

    This routine is used by Riap client libraries, e.g.
    Perinci::Access::Lite, Perinci::Access::Perl, and
    Perinci::Access::HTTP::Client, Perinci::Access::Simple::Client.

    If there is no error, will return $envres with all "riap.*" keys already
    stripped. If there is an error, an error response will be returned
    instead. Either way, you can use the response returned by this function
    to user.
